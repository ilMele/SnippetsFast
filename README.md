# SnippetsFast

this is my first C# project while i'm learning it, this program allows you to search and copy your snippets quickly, i was inspired by a program that exists on macOS.

## Usage
This program creates and uses a folder in Documents called "SnippetsFast", all text files(snippets) wil go inside it.
